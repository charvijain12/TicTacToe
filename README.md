# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in C

This is a source code for a two-player Tic Tac Toe game written in C. It uses a character array called "square" to represent the game board, where each element in the array represents a square on the board. The players take turns entering a number that corresponds to the square they want to place their marker in (X or O). The game continues until either one of the players wins or there are no more moves left. The "checkwin" function checks the game board after each move to determine if there has been a win. The "board" function is used to display the game board. The game is played in a loop that continues until the "checkwin" function returns either 0 (draw) or 1 (win).
